# 🎓 Placement Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning-based placement prediction system that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their **IQ level** and **CGPA**. It is designed to help students and institutions understand the relationship between academic performance and placement success.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts placement status (`Placed` or `Not Placed`) using IQ and CGPA
- Trained on a clean dataset with supervised learning models
- Supports model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- Easy to understand, extend, and deploy

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Input Features**: IQ, CGPA
- **Target Output**: Placement Status
- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression (can be extended to other models)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vivek-ML001/Palcement_prediction.git
   cd Palcement_prediction

python -m venv placement_env
placement_env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

python placement_predictor.py

Let me know if you want this as a **Jupyter Notebook project**, want to add **graphs**, or include a **Streamlit web app version** – I’ll tailor the README further!
